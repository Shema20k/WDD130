            Hello, my name is Shema Darcy from Kigali, Rwanda, and I'm a serious Christian.<br>
            I enjoy playing basketball and coding. I'm currently studying software
            development at Brigham Young University–Idaho.<br>
            I'm excited to learn more about software development. I'm looking
            forward to creating my own world of coding, just as Elon Musk did with his companies.

            Rwanda, known as the “Land of a Thousand Hills,” is a beautiful country in East Africa. 
            It is famous for its rolling green hills, wildlife, and rapidly growing technology sector.
