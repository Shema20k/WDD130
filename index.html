            Hello, my name is Shema Darcy from Kigali, Rwanda, and I'm a serious Christian.<br>
            I enjoy playing basketball and coding. I'm currently studying software
            development at Brigham Young Universityâ€“Idaho.<br>
            I'm excited to learn more about software development. I'm looking
            forward to creating my own world of coding, just as Elon Musk did with his companies.
